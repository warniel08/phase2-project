# phase2-project

## Summary
In this challenge, I am building a blog that allows users to register, login/logout, create posts and make comments to the blog. I will implement a weather api for some api practice.

### Authentication and Authorization
Anybody can create a new account. The passwords will be stored as a password-hash using 'BCrypt'. Users that do not register can still look at posts and comments but will not be able to post or comment until they register and/or login.

*Note:* This blog was made using Sinatra and Ruby with a PostgreSQL server. The weather api provided by Weather Underground.
